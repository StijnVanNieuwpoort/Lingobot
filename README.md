# Lingobot
Welcome to the Lingobot! Here you can play a game if Lingo by running the pygame_playergame.py file in the Games folder.

To test out the algorithm:
1. Make sure to run the filler_outcomes.py first to fill the word-outcomes.json file with the necessary data for the algorithm to function properly.
2. Run pygame_computergame.py to see the algorithm solve a word. Or run computergame.py for a console vieuw with more control (adding prints for example).

To run tests:
Three test files are present in this project: testEntropy.py, testEvaluation.py and testGametools.py.
